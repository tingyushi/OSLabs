The following are lab procedures:
1. Initialization with 1MB of the free memory at the start.
2. Fill up the 1MB memory with processes. The size of each process is an integer multiple of 4KB.
3. Remove 10% of the processes randomly.
4. Using three fits algorithms to fill the memory holes.
5. Do step 4 with compactions.
6. Compare the memory utilization rate of three algorithms. Also compare memory utilization rate of compaction and without compaction.
